now every inch of slavation u know i m gonna travel i am 
escaping to the place where all the judges lost their gavel singing
where h'v u been
where u at
everu  i did
i can take it back

i cant move on
i cant relax
coz when ur gone
PANIC ATTACKS

started taking pills and now i am living all right(girl)



now all the butterflies have turned to vultures in my stomach.
where u been
whera u at
everything i did i can take it back


i cant move on
i cant relax
coz when ur gone
PANIC ATTACKS

OOoooooo.oooooo
