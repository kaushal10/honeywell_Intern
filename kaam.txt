serviceprinciple is central acc type to get access on azure vms .
ask yogita for subsription for reader (linux machine)
execute a simple command like ifconfig on a linux vm.
imort azure vm for pwoershell on ur local machine and execute these commands.
talk to sabari also about all this , he knows alot about octopus. 
kbye


create a process in octopus and try to run ur script from the portal itself. ask sabari how he had
he had done this. 
u dont have to run from powershell.
yogita's script ko run karna hai portal me kuch kuch karke :P


try to do some inline scripting on octopus only, see if ifconfig works , if yes then try
the actual script there itself. 
move to production after navia reviewing once. 

ask sabari for deplotment process step and ask which deployment target. she said something
like you have to use some existing tentacle(a windows server which can perform octopus tasks)
ask yogita to demo a deployment process and show logs. This is where u will see the results
of ur inline scripts.

vm has a role. ask navya to create a role for you. process step attatches to a role. then
in deployment target just pass the role. bamboo passes the package to octopus. scripts/{filename}.ps1
will be the path to the script.
